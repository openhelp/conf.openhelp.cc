<title>Code of Conduct</title>

<p>Open Help is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference
experience for everyone. We do not tolerate harassment of conference
participants in any form. Conference participants violating these
rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference without a
refund at the discretion of the conference organizers.</p>

<p>Harassment includes verbal comments that reinforce social structures
of domination; sexual images in public spaces; deliberate intimidation;
stalking; following; harassing photography or recording; sustained
disruption of talks or other events; inappropriate physical contact;
and unwelcome sexual attention. Participants asked to stop any harassing
behavior are expected to comply immediately.</p>

<p>If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the conference
organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including
warning the offender or expulsion from the conference with no refund.
If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed,
or have any other concerns, please contact a member of conference
staff immediately.</p>

<p>Conference staff will be happy to help participants contact venue
security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise
assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration
of the conference. We value your attendance.</p>

<p>We expect participants to follow these rules at all conference
venues and conference-related social events.</p>
